# US Healthcare Charges Data Analysis

## Overview
This project analyzes two datasets related to U.S. healthcare:

Insurance Charges Dataset (insurance.csv)

Compare average charges for smokers vs. non-smokers.
Determine which U.S. region has the highest average medical charges.
Examine average charges by BMI category.
Produce bar charts for charges by region and by BMI category.
Claims Dataset (claim_data.csv)

Calculate the percentage of denied claims for Commercial vs. Medicare insurance types.
Investigate the relationship between billed amount and claim denial status, including whether claims over $200 are more likely to be denied.
Produce a bar chart showing the percentage of denied claims by insurance type.

## Running Instructions

Install required libraries:
bash
Copy code

Place insurance.csv and claim_data.csv in the same folder as data_analysis.py.
